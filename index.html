        <p>Singing has always been one of my favorite things to do. 
            For me, singing is a way to relax. Besides relaxing, 
            there are other physical, phsycological, and emotional
            benefits that comes from singing on a regular basis.</p>
        <h1>Physical Benefits of Singing</h1>   
        <p>Singing can be an excellent form of exercise. Your lungs 
            will get a workout as you employ proper singing techniques
            and vocal projections.  Singing also strengthens your diaphram.
            While singing, standing up straight is a part of correct 
            technique which will improve your posture.</p>
        <h1>Phsycological and Emotonal Benefits</h1>
        <p>Singing is a natural anti-depressant. 
            When you sing, your brain releases endorphins, a chemical in your
            brain that makes you feel happy or uplifted. In addition, scientist 
            have found an organ in the ear called sacculus that responds to
            the frequencies created by singing. The response creates a feeling 
            of pleasure, regardless of what the singing sounds like.</p>
